🔬 About Me

I’m a Computer Science undergraduate (Pre-Final Year) with hands-on experience in Machine Learning, Backend Engineering, and Intelligent System Development within high-security, government-grade environments.

I have contributed to production-oriented ML systems and AI-driven security pipelines at:

🛡️ DESIDOC, DRDO (Ministry of Defence) — Machine Learning–based anomaly detection systems
🔐 Inland Waterways Authority of India (MoPSW) — AI-driven threat detection and secure infrastructure architecture

I focus on building production-grade Machine Learning systems with emphasis on scalability, model reliability, and real-world deployment.

I enjoy building systems that combine:

Intelligence + Scalability + Reliability + Real-World Impact

Long-term vision: Contribute to advanced AI systems, Quantum Computing research, and large-scale distributed computing infrastructure.
